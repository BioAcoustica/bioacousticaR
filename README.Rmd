bioacousticaR
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BioAcoustica/bioacousticaR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BioAcoustica/bioacousticaR)

An `R` package interfacing [BioAcoustica](http://bio.acousti.ca).

BioAcoustica is a sound repository and analysis platform for recordings of wildlife sound.
This package provides a toolbox to search and retrieve recordings in order to build a local collection for subsequent analysis.


A world of annotations 
----------------------------

Bioacoustica webserver allows users to tag segments of recordings.
This generates so called **"annotations"**.
Each annotation has a unique identifier, a parent audio file, a start and an end time, and other informations (taxon, author,...).

An analysis project will generally involve:

* Uploading recodings
* Annotating regions of interest
* Downloading and analysing annotation audio data

The [BioAcoustica website](http://bio.acousti.ca) should allow users to perform the two first actions, whislt the pakage herein focuses on the last point.
In other words, `bioacousticaR` is a tool to fetch files corresponding to annotations in order to process them locally.

A concrete example:
----------------------

A bioacoustica user, `qgeissmann`, performed annotations online between October 22th and November 1st. We would like to fetch all the corresponding data, save it locally and analyse it.

In `R`, we will start by listing available annotations:

```R
library(bioacoustica)
all_annotations <- getAllAnnotationData()
print(colnames(all_annotations))
print(all_annotations[, .(author, date, taxon)])
```

Now, we have a `data.table` (a `data.table` is essentially a `data.frame` with extra functionalities) containing a list of annotations (one per row).
We then can *select* the subset of annotation we are interested about: all annotations made by "qgeissmann", after "2016-10-22" and before after "2016-11-01".

```R
target_annotations <- all_annotations[author == "qgeissmann" &
                                      date > "2016-10-22" &
                                      date < "2016-11-01"]
```

Now we can actually download one audio segment for each annotation.
We just need to define where to save these files.
In a real life scenario, you would manage and create your own directory.
However, for the sake of the example, we will create a temperary one (`DATA_DIR`).

```R
DATA_DIR <- file.path(tempdir(),"ba_example")
dir.create(DATA_DIR)
target_annotations <- dowloadFilesForAnnotations(target_annotations,
                                dst_dir = DATA_DIR,
                                verbose=T)
```                         

Now, `target_annotations` has been updated with a new column (`annotation_path`) that refers to the path of the saved file.
By default, a file that was already present in the direcory will not be re-downloaded, so your collection can be built incrementally.

As a simple example, we could open each file and retrieve its duration:

```R
getDuration <- function(file){
  wav <- tuneR::readWave(file)
  length(wav@left) / wav@samp.rate
}
# we use the magic of data.table `by`:
durations  <- target_annotations[ ,
                                  .(duration = getDuration(annotation_path)),
                                  by=id]
print(durations)
```

This way, we have one annotation per id.

The same approach can be used to make much more complicated analysis. For instance, you could replace `getDuration()` by a function that computes a power spectrum (as long as you return it as a `data.table`).


For instance, we would like to make a mean frequency spectrum (`seewave::meanspec`) for each annotation, and then plot spectrum vs species
